# Personal Finance for Newbies (PFN)

## What is that?
A web app that, from a file of (buy/sell) financial asset transactions, produces near real-time statistics (updated to the last closing) on your investment portfolio

## How can I run it?

### Streamlit
Install dependencies via poetry

- `poetry install`

Launch the app

- `streamlit run 0_üè†_Home.py`

### Docker
To build the app's docker image

- `docker build -t personal-finance-for-newbies .`

To run the docker image and expose it on a preferred port (for example 8080)

- `docker run -p 8080:8501 personal-finance-for-newbies`

To run the docker image using the host's network (which will make the app accessible on port 8501)

- `docker run --network host personal-finance-for-newbies`

## How can I use my own data?
To load and use your data, download and fill in the template with your accumulation plan's buy/sell transactions and upload it.
Make sure you fill it in correctly. The fields to be entered are:

- **Exchange**: name of the market (according to Yahoo Finance) [https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN2310.html](list of exchange suffixes);
- **Ticker**: symbol to identify a publicly traded security;
- **Transaction Date**: date of transaction in DD/MM/YYYY format;
- **Shares**: number of purchased/sold shares; please, include a minus sign to indicate selling;
- **Price**: price of a single share;
- **Fees**: transaction fees, if any.
